=========================================
 Gaussian Mixture Model based Algorithms
=========================================

This package is part of the ``bob.bio`` packages, which provide open source tools to run comparable and reproducible biometric recognition experiments.
In this package, algorithms for executing experiments based on Gaussian Mixture Models are provided, including scripts to run the training procedures of the Expectation-Maximization loops in parallel.

For more detailed information about the structure of the ``bob.bio`` packages, please refer to the documentation of :ref:`bob.bio.base <bob.bio.base>`.
Particularly, the installation of this and other ``bob.bio`` packages, please read the :ref:`bob.bio.base.installation`.

In the following, we provide more detailed information about the particularities of this package only.
